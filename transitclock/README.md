# Trak's `Transit Clock` template

This is a deployment of [Transit Clock](https://github.com/TheTransitClock/transitime), adapted from [transitclockDocker](https://github.com/TheTransitClock/transitclockDocker).

This server is designed to automatically provide GTFS-RT VehiclePositions and TripUpdates from backend vehicle responses.

It should then be hooked up to `otp` to provide live predictions for buses.
